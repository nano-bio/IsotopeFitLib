# IsotopeFitLib
C++ libraries used for IsotopeFit

Forward step this time. I have uploaded projects for dynamic libraries and test programs for Win and Linux. They work, while having the same code. Disadvantage is I had both Visual Studio on Windows machine and Netbeans on Linux machine open, so it is not very practical in terms of writing and managing the code. Will look into that.
